		<h1>The Importance of Coding and Cybersecurity</h1><br>
		<p align="justify">Coding has become an essential skill in today's world. With the increasing use of technology, software engineers and developers are in high demand. They create applications and programs that make our lives easier, more efficient, and more productive.

		However, with great power comes great responsibility. As we rely more on technology, we must also take steps to ensure that our information is secure. Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from digital attacks, theft, or damage. Without proper cybersecurity measures, sensitive information such as personal data, financial information, and business secrets can be compromised.

		Coding and cybersecurity go hand in hand. A skilled programmer can create secure and reliable systems that protect against digital threats. As a result, companies and organizations are always on the lookout for individuals with expertise in coding and cybersecurity.

		Moreover, coding is not just limited to professionals. With online coding resources and coding bootcamps, anyone can learn to code. This empowers individuals to create their own applications and websites, start their own businesses, and contribute to the tech industry.

		In conclusion, coding and cybersecurity are important skills that have a significant impact on our lives. They offer great career opportunities and can help protect against digital threats. By learning to code and practicing proper cybersecurity measures, we can help ensure a secure and thriving digital world.</p>

				<h2><img src="img/html.png" width="100px" height="100px" alt="html-logo"/>     HTML</h2>
				<p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It provides a way to structure content using various elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and images. HTML documents are interpreted by web browsers and transformed into the visual and interactive elements that make up modern websites.</p>

				<h2><img src="img/css.png" width="100px" height="100px" alt="css-logo"/>     CSS</h2>
				<p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of HTML documents. It provides a way to style and layout web pages using properties such as colors, fonts, margins, and positioning. CSS allows web designers to create visually appealing and responsive websites that adapt to different devices and screen sizes.</p>

				<h2><img src="img/js.png" width="100px" height="100px" alt="javascript-logo"/> JavaScript</h2>
				<p>JavaScript is a programming language used to create dynamic and interactive web pages. It provides a way to add behavior to HTML and CSS elements, such as user interaction, form validation, and dynamic content. JavaScript is executed by web browsers and can interact with other web technologies such as HTML5 APIs, CSS frameworks, and server-side languages.</p>

				<h2><img src="img/bootstrap.png" width="100px" height="100px" alt="bootstrap-logo"/> Bootstrap</h2>
				<p>Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains HTML, CSS and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.</p>

				<h2><img src="img/php.png" width="100px" height="100px" alt="php-logo"/> PHP</h2>
				<p>PHP is a widely used server-side scripting language that has become increasingly fast and powerful through the years. You can also use it on the front-end since PHP can be embedded right into HTML. These features make learning PHP a great option for any web developer.</p>

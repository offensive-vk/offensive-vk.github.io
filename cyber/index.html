Explain in detail about the defense with examples.</h3><div class="affine-block-children-container" style="padding-left: 26px;"></div></div><div class="affine-paragraph-block-container"><p>DNS (Domain Name System) poisoning, also known as DNS spoofing, is a type of cyber attack where the attacker corrupts the DNS cache of a DNS server or client device. By doing so, the attacker can redirect DNS requests to malicious websites, intercept sensitive information, or conduct phishing attacks.</p><div class="affine-block-children-container" style="padding-left: 26px;"></div></div><div class="affine-paragraph-block-container"><p>Here's how DNS poisoning typically works:</p><div class="affine-block-children-container" style="padding-left: 26px;"></div></div><div class="affine-list-block-container"><ol style=""><li><strong>DNS Cache Poisoning</strong>: In this scenario, the attacker sends falsified DNS information to a DNS server, which then caches the malicious data. When users request a DNS resolution for a specific domain name, the compromised DNS server returns the manipulated IP address, directing users to the attacker-controlled server instead of the legitimate one.</li></ol><div class="affine-block-children-container" style="padding-left: 26px;"></div></div><div class="affine-list-block-container"><ol style=""><li><strong>Client-Side DNS Spoofing</strong>: Instead of targeting DNS servers directly, attackers may exploit vulnerabilities in client devices or routers to manipulate their DNS cache. By doing so, they can redirect DNS requests from individual devices, leading users to malicious websites or servers.</li></ol><div class="affine-block-children-container" style="padding-left: 26px;"></div></div><div class="affine-paragraph-block-container"><p>Defense against DNS poisoning involves several strategies and best practices:</p><div class="affine-block-children-container" style="padding-left: 26px;"></div></div><div class="affine-list-block-container"><ol style=""><li><strong>DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions)</strong>: DNSSEC is a set of extensions to DNS that add cryptographic security features to prevent DNS spoofing and cache poisoning attacks. DNSSEC uses digital signatures to authenticate DNS responses, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of DNS data. By validating DNSSEC signatures, DNS resolvers can detect and reject spoofed or tampered DNS records.Example: Suppose a user's device requests the IP address for a domain name protected by DNSSEC. If the DNS resolver detects that the DNS response lacks valid signatures or has been tampered with, it will reject the response and prevent the user from accessing the potentially malicious website.</li></ol><div class="affine-block-children-container" style="padding-left: 26px;"></div></div><div class="affine-list-block-container"><ol style=""><li><strong>Use of DNS Caching Resolvers</strong>: DNS caching resolvers cache DNS records obtained from authoritative DNS servers to improve performance and reduce DNS lookup latency. However, these resolvers should implement safeguards to prevent cache poisoning attacks. For example, they can use randomization techniques or source port randomization to make it harder for attackers to predict and spoof DNS query and response identifiers.Example: If an attacker attempts to poison the DNS cache of a caching resolver, the resolver's randomization mechanisms may prevent the attacker from successfully correlating their spoofed DNS responses with legitimate DNS queries, reducing the effectiveness of the attack.</li></ol><div class="affine-block-children-container" style="padding-left: 26px;"></div></div><div class="affine-list-block-container"><ol style=""><li><strong>Network Segmentation and Firewalls</strong>: Organizations can use network segmentation and firewalls to restrict access to DNS servers and prevent unauthorized users or devices from tampering with DNS traffic. By implementing access controls and firewall rules, organizations can limit the attack surface and reduce the risk of DNS poisoning.Example: A firewall configured to block inbound traffic to DNS servers from external networks can prevent attackers from directly targeting DNS servers with spoofed DNS queries or responses.</li></ol><div class="affine-block-children-container" style="padding-left: 26px;"></div></div><div class="affine-list-block-container"><ol style=""><li><strong>Regular Security Updates and Patch Management</strong>: Keeping DNS server software and client devices up to date with the latest security patches and updates helps mitigate vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit to execute DNS poisoning attacks. Regular security updates can address known vulnerabilities and security weaknesses, reducing the likelihood of successful attacks.Example: Suppose a DNS server software vendor releases a security patch to address a critical vulnerability that could be exploited for DNS cache poisoning. By promptly applying the patch to their DNS servers, organizations can protect against potential exploitation of the vulnerability by attackers.</li></ol><div class="affine-block-children-container" style="padding-left: 26px;"></div></div><hr><div class="affine-paragraph-block-container"><h2>What are the differences between Virus and Worms and Trojan ?
